# Human_Activity_Recognition_with_Smartphones

The overall goal of this project is to build classification models to identify activities of daily living (ADL) into one of the six categories.

For this project, we are going to use the dataset ‘Human Activity Recognition with Smartphones’ from UCI Machine Learning with link below
https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/human-activity-recognition-with-smartphones

In this dataset, we have 561 attributes and 7352 records. For each record in the dataset, it is provided:
•	Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
•	Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
•	A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
•	its activity label. 
•	An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment. 

We will use below major units in this project:

Dimension reduction:
* Principal Component Analysis

Classification models:
* k-nearest neighbor
*	logistic regression
* random forest
